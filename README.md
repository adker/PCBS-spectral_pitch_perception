# PCBS-spectral_pitch_perception
project for PCBS class

## Subject: auditory percption (pitch perception)

The aim of the project is to study the perception of overtone singing. 

## Background information

(virtual pitch, spectral pitch, temporal vs spectral models for pitch perception)

## Description

The project consiste of a pychophysics experiment to decide between two possible models of perception of spectral pitch:
- according to the first model, the spectral pitch correspond the inverse of the position of the first peack of the sound autocorrelation AC) function
- according to the second model, the spectral pitch correspond the spectral controid of the sound

The pitches predicted par the two moels are represented here:

### Hypothesis

Our hypothesis is that the perceived spectral pitch will follow the AC model for low spectral pitches (partials are resolved) and that it will follows the spectral centroid for higher spectral pitches (unresolved partials). 

### Task

At every trial we try try to find witch of the two models fits best the spectral pitch elicited by a given complexe sound.
Participants are presented two pairs of sound consisting of one sine wave and the complex tone. They are asked to choose which of the two pair consist of sounds that "match the best" together".
We assume that the sine wave whose frequency is the closest to the perceived spectral pitch of the complexe sound will be perceived to "matches the best" with this sound.
